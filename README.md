## **Project Overview**

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my work in web design and development. As both a designer and a developer, my goal was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive website that reflects my passion for crafting seamless web experiences.

This portfolio includes a collection of design and development projects I've worked on, ranging from user interfaces to full-fledged web applications. I also aim to demonstrate my ability to create websites that are optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5** - For structuring the content.
- **CSS3** - For styling the website, including responsiveness and layout.
- **JavaScript** - For adding interactive features and dynamic behavior.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** - For smooth, scroll-triggered animations.
- **ScrollTrigger** - For triggering animations as users scroll down the page.
- **Responsive Design** - Ensuring a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## **Key Features**

- **Homepage**: The homepage is clean and straightforward, featuring a brief introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **Projects**: This section highlights six of my major projects. These include both design and development works, each presented with a detailed description.
- **Contact Me**: A contact section where visitors can easily get in touch with me.

## **Design Philosophy**

My design approach focuses on simplicity, ease of navigation, and a visually cohesive experience. The color palette I chose, consisting of **dark tones** for the primary background and **white for the font**, creates a minimalist feel that puts the focus on the content. Typography has been carefully selected to provide readability and modern aesthetics.

**Color Palette**:
- Primary Color: #28282b (Dark background)
- Secondary Color: #FFFFFF (White text)
- Highlight Color: #FFFFFF (White accents for emphasis)

**Typography**:
- Font Family: **Malaga OTCE** (Bold and Italic Bold for headings and emphasis)

## **Features**

1. **Interactive Animations**: Leveraging GSAP and ScrollTrigger, I added animations that engage users as they scroll through the website, enhancing the experience and making it more dynamic.
   
2. **Responsive Layout**: The website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring that the design remains intuitive and visually appealing on both desktops and mobile devices.

3. **User-Centered Navigation**: I implemented a hamburger menu for mobile devices, improving usability without sacrificing design. The navigation becomes fully interactive with smooth transitions and animations.
